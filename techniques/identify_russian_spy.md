Based on Christo Grozev's investigation, I've extracted his process for identifying the spy's real identity. Here's the systematic approach he used, which can be applied more generally:

# Process for Identifying a Spy with a Cover Identity

1. **Verify if the cover identity is real**
   - Check government databases for the claimed identity
   - Look for inconsistencies in official records (passport issuance dates, tax numbers)
   - Verify physical addresses and employment claims
   - Search for digital footprints (social media, email accounts, photographs)
   - Note suspicious patterns like "fresh" documentation that appeared recently

2. **Analyze key identifiers that often remain consistent**
   - First name (spies often keep their real first name for ease of memory)
   - Birth date (sometimes changed but often in predictable ways)
   - Zodiac sign (rarely changed due to cultural significance)
   - Physical characteristics that can't be easily altered

3. **Cross-reference with relevant databases**
   - Search for individuals with matching key identifiers (first name + zodiac sign)
   - Look for individuals with similar criminal patterns or MO
   - Check for suspicious government intervention (e.g., recalled arrest warrants)

4. **Establish visual confirmation**
   - Obtain photographs of potential real identity matches
   - Perform forensic comparison with available images of the suspect
   - Verify physical characteristics match

5. **Prove government connections**
   - Analyze communication patterns (phone records, metadata)
   - Track visits to government facilities
   - Identify connections to known government operatives
   - Document specialized training that matches the crime methodology

This process demonstrates how open-source intelligence (OSINT) and data journalism techniques can uncover hidden identities by methodically connecting disparate pieces of information from multiple sources.
